## Technologies used

For now we are focused on html, css and Javascript + whatever libraries are needed.


## Git and Github

This repo has been created to improve members' collaborative skills using Git version control.

Git is a version control technology used by developers to track changes, go back to previous versions of working code and limit the amount of bugs intruduced to the code base. Github is where you store the code and make it accessible to all collaborators.

IMPORTANT: see our GIT_GUIDE.md in the root of this repo before you contribute to the project.
